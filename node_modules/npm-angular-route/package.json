  "readme": "# npm-angular-route\n\nThis repo is for distribution on `NPM`. This is basically an NPM require-able clone of the bower repo from [angular/bower-angular-route](https://github.com/angular/bower-angular-route).\n\nThe source for this module is in the\n[main AngularJS repo](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/tree/master/src/ngRoute).\nPlease file issues and pull requests against that repo. Only file issues here if I forget to bump a version.\n\n## Install\n\nInstall with npm:\n\n```shell\nnpm install npm-angular-route\n```\n\nYou can then require it by requiring it.\n```javascript\nvar angular = require('angular')\nrequire('./angular-router')(window, angular)\n```\n\nWhich in turns allows you to add it to your module's dependencies and use it as you wish.\n\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
